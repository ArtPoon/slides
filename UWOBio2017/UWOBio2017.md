# An evolutionary history of drug resistance
## HCV and Simeprevir

* Treatment with ribavirin, pegylated interferon was ineffective, bad side effects
* Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) are capable of clearing HCV infection in over 90% of cases
* Simeprevir was the first DAA to receive FDA approval ($66,000 per 3 months treatment!)

---

# An evolutionary history of drug resistance
## Testing for Q80K

* DAAs are more effective for some HCV genotypes (clades) than others
* HCV 1a is the most prevalent in North America
* Q80K mutation in HCV NS3 protease makes Simeprevir less effective
* BC started to develop a genotype test for Q80K

---

# An evolutionary history of drug resistance
## Q80K in Europe

* Clinical trials of Simeprevir were carried out in Europe
* Growing suspicion that Q80K is far more common in North American than European 1a's - *why?*

# An evolutionary history of drug resistance
## Locking a mutation with epistasis

* Distribution of Q80K suggests a fitness peak shift:

</tr></table>


---

# An evolutionary history of drug resistance
## What does this mean?

* Q80K/S174N has been stably transmitted in North America for decades.
* With rollout of Simeprevir, we should expect these mutations to sweep to fixation.
* Drug companies now recommend prescribing Simeprevir in combination with a second drug (Sofosbuvir), about $150,000 per treatment

# Baby boomers and HCV
## Why is HCV so prevalent in baby boomers?

* HCV infection can be asymptomatic for decades - most are unaware of their infection.
* Experimenting with drugs, multiple sexual partners?
* Who will pay for the cost of treatment?
* When did they get infected?

* Egypt has the highest rate of HCV in the world (~30% of adults)
* Nearly all infections by a single clade (genotype 4a)

## HIV-1

* HIV-1 crossed over multiple times from non-human primates
* About 36.7 million people now living with HIV-1
* Modern drug treatment can restore a normal life expentancy
* Only about half of those living with HIV-1 receiving treatment
* <b>Treatment is a life-long burden</b>

# Detecting outbreaks
## What is an outbreak?

* A group of infections that are clustered in space and/or time 
* Clustering implies a common source
* Clusters may represent the most effective targets for public health intervention

---

# Detecting outbreaks
## Defining genetic clusters

* A genetic cluster is a group of sequences that are more similar to each other than the rest of the sample population
* We can measure similarity with a genetic distance function, or within a phylogeny
* Clusters are often visualized with network diagrams - *not the same as a contact network!*

---

# Genetic clustering
## Do these methods actually work?

* Methods for genetic clustering in HIV are *nonparametric*
* How well does clustering work?  There are two reasons for genetic similarity:
  1. A high transmission rate: less time between transmission events
  2. A high sampling rate: less time until a new infection is sequenced
