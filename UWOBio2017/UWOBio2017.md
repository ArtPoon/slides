# Hepatitis C virus

* (+)ss-RNA virus causing liver cancer
* over 71 million people with chronic infection, killing about 400,000 every year
* ancient origin
* clustered into six major clades

# HCV and Simeprevir

* Treatment with ribavirin, pegylated interferon was ineffective, bad side effects
* Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) are capable of clearing HCV infection in over 90% of cases
* Simeprevir was the first DAA to receive FDA approval ($66,000 per 3 months treatment!)

# Q80K

* DAAs are more effective for some HCV genotypes (clades) than others
* HCV 1a is the most prevalent in North America
* Q80K mutation in HCV NS3 protease makes Simeprevir less effective
* BC started to develop a genotype test for Q80K
* Q80K was more frequent in North American than European 1a's - *why?*

# Locking a mutation with epistasis

* Q80K is almost never seen any other HCV genotypes
* Distribution in phylogeny suggests a peak shift
