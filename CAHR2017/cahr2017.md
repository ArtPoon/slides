## What is a genetic cluster?

<table><tr>
    <td width="50%">
    <ul>
        <li>A subset of sequences that are more similar to each other than the rest of the sample</li>
        <li>There are many methods for defining clusters</li>
        <li>Clustering is subjective</li>
    </ul>

## Clustering and epidemiology

<table><tr>
    <td width="50%"><ul>
    <li>Early examples: characterizing outbreaks of HSV-1, TB from RFLPs</li>
    <li>Low genetic divergence may indicate recent transmission</li>
    <li>Tremendous interest in applying clustering to HIV outbreaks</li>
    <li>These methods have seldom been tested!</li>
    </ul>

</tr></table>

## Simulations

* Simulated trees (*MASTER* v5.0) under an epidemic model with 2 subpopulations
* Varied transmission and sampling rate of minority subpopulation

## Visualization

<table><tr>
    <td width="50%"><ul>
    <li>4 scenarios (faster sampling and/or transmission)</li>
    <li>Faster sampling should shorten terminal branches</li>
    ![](short-tips.png)
    <li>Faster transmission should shorten internal branches</li>
    ![](short-internals.png)
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
         ![](/CAHR2017/branch-lengths.png)
    </td>
</tr></table>

## Example tree

![](color-tree-90.png)

Simulation, both transmission and sampling rates elevated in minority subpop (cyan).

---

## Method comparison

* Simulated sequence evolution along each tree (*INDELIBLE*)
* Evaluated six different clustering methods
 1. HIV-Trace (*TN93*)
 2. Patristic distance
 3. Subtree clustering (bootstrap, branch-lengths)
 4. ClusterPicker
 5. GapProcedure
 6. PhyloPart

## Clustering doesn't seem to work

* Current methods <u>*applied to simulations*</u> detect clusters of sampling, not clusters of transmission.
* Are we targeting public health responses on the most engaged groups?
* Can we develop a clustering method that targets variation in transmission rates?

---

## Focusing on transmission

* We assume the phylogeny approximates the transmission tree (no different from clustering)
* Let branching rate $\lambda$ switch between $K$ values along the tree$^*$
* Solve for maximum likelihood assignment of rates to branches

## Results

<table>
  <tr>
  <td>Cluster Picker</td>
  <td>New method</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td width="50%">![](fastTrans7.cpick.png)</td>
  <td>![](fastTrans7.mmpp.png)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<small>Dots ("$\cdot$") indicate true minority sequences; higher transmission rates</small>

## Concluding remarks

* Some clusters are unambiguous (*e.g.,* Indiana, Saskatchewan)
* We need to be more skeptical about clustering methods
* Focusing on internal branch lengths may provide more informative clusters
