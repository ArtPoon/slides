# Microbes are everywhere
* Total biomass
* Torque teno virus

---

# Why are some microbes pathogenic?
* Virulence
* Zoonosis
* Is pathogenesis a side-effect of spill-over from natural host species?

---

# Old pathogens

* Measles
* Endogenous retroviruses
* Origin of placentas

---

# New (emerging) pathogens

* HIV-1
* Zika virus
* Ebola virus

# What drove this Ebola outbreak?

* There have been several smaller outbreaks of Ebola virus in the past
* Past outbreaks associated with unusually dry conditions following the rainy season*

# Reconstructing the past
* We usually don't have samples from the start of an outbreak

# Phylogenies

* A phylogeny is a tree-based model of how populations are related by their common ancestors

---

# Building trees

* Models of evolution
* Maximum likelihood
