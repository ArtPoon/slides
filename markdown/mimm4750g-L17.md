# Now you have data

* Congratulations!  You have several hundred gigabytes of data.
* Before you start to learn how to *analyze* the data, you need to check if it is any good.
* Quality control is a necessary and tedious step of NGS analysis.
* We will focus on Illumina sequencing - there are many other platforms but right now Illumina is fairly popular.

---

# Demultiplexing

* One of the first steps in processing raw NGS outputs
* Generates FASTQ from base call `.bcl` files
* This conversion used to be performed with a Perl script `bcl2fastq.pl`
* Has now been re-implemented as a C++ program `bcl2fastq2`
* Separates reads labelled with different index tags into different FASTQ files.

---

# Quality control

* **Number of reads:** a sample may have a small number of reads, possibly due to inaccurate DNA quantification
* **Quality scores:** read quality tends to fall off over cycles.
* **Nucleotide frequencies:** skewed frequencies can reflect poor quality.

---

# QC Software

* Several different software packages are available for screening FASTQ data for quality; for example:

# Trimming adapters

* Illumina adapters are short nucleotide sequences (oligos) that are used in the construction of the sequencing library
* If the DNA fragment is shorter than the read, then the sequence may "read-through" to the adapter on the other end.
* Adapter contamination: many genomes in Genbank are contaminated with adapter sequences that were not removed by the authors.
* *e.g.*, the [carp genome](http://www.opiniomics.org/we-need-to-stop-making-this-simple-fcking-mistake/)

# Open-source

* What is it?
