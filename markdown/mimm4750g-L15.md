# Models of epidemics

* Suppose a single infected individual enters a population.
* Let $I$ be the number of infected people.
* Let $S$ be the number of uninfected people susceptible to infection.
* Let $\beta$ be the rate that a susceptible person who comes in contact with an infected person becomes infected.
* The rate of new infections is $\beta S I$.

---

# The dumb assumptions

1. The population is "well mixed".  Any one person is equally likely to come into contact with any other person.

2. The transmission rate $\beta$ is the same for everybody, *forever*.

3. The size of the total population does not change.

# SI dynamics

* This model is known as the susceptible-infected (SI) model.
* $I$ increases at the fastest rate when $S=I$.

# Compartmental models

* The SI model belongs to a class of epidemic models known as [compartmental models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology).
* A compartment is a sub-population with distinct numbers and rate parameters.
* These models are generally represented by systems of differential equations.
* For example, the SI model can be written as:

$$\frac{dS}{dt}=-\beta S I, \; \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta S I$$

# Compartmental models

* SIS: infected individuals recover and become susceptible again.
* SIR: adds a "removed" compartment where infected individuals eventually *recover* or *die*.
* SEIR: individuals become *exposed* but not immediately infectious.
* and many others!

# $R_0$

* "R naught" (basic reproduction number) is a fundamental parameter of epidemiology.
* The expected number of secondary cases from the index case.
* If $R_0<1$, then we expect the infection to die out.  If $R_0>1$, then we expect it to spread.
* For the SIR model (with death rate $\gamma$), 

  $$R_0 = \frac{\beta N}{\gamma}$$
  
* Increases with transmission rate ($\beta$), and declines with death rate $\gamma$.

---

# Birth-death models

* The transmission of a pathogen to a new host is a *lineage birth*.
* The removal of an infected individual by recovery or death is a *lineage death*.
* If we follow these lineages forward in time, we can generate a tree.

# Coalescent and birth-death

* Both are models of how trees are shaped by population-level processes.

| Coalescent | Birth-death |
|------------|-------------|
| Reverse time | Forward time |
| Assumes $n<<N$ | Robust to large $n$ |
| Sampling times are data | Sampling must be modeled |
| No selection | Can handle selection naturally |
| BEAST 1 | BEAST 2 |

# BEAST

* Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees
* Primarily developed by Alexei Drummond and Andrew Rambaut in Java.
* Has become one of the most influential software packages in infectious disease research in the last decade.
* Over 10,000 citations, including over 40 Nature papers and over 20 Science papers since 2007.

---

# BEAST

* Can use the coalescent or birth-death model as a prior over trees.
* Rearranges and rescales parts of the tree to explore the posterior distribution.
* At the same time, samples parameters of a model of evolution that is needed to reconstruct the tree from sequences.
