# What is a molecular clock?

<table>
  <tr>
  <td><ul>
    <li>The molecular clock is a hypothesis that evolution at a molecular level (*e.g.,* proteins) occurs at a constant rate.</li>
    <li>Based on linear relationship between the time that species diverged from their common ancestor, and the number of amino acid differences in homologous proteins (*right*).</li>
    <li>The molecular clock does *not* "tick".</li>
  </ul></td>

# Neutral theory

<table>
  <tr>
  <td><ul>
    <li>The neutral theory: "the great majority of evolutionary changes at the molecular level [...] are caused not by Darwinian selection but by random drift"</li>
    <li>Without selection, nucleotide substitutions should be a random process at a constant rate.</li>
    <li>Today, this model is denoted the "strict" clock and is seldom supported.</li>

# Testing for a clock

* Root-to-tip regression

# Clocks and trees

* When we reconstruct a tree by fitting a model of evolution, the lengths of branches are measured in units of *expected numbers of substitutions*.

* This weird unit exists because most models are scaled to $\mu\times t$ (the rate of evolution multiplied by time).

* We say that the rate and time are *confounded* - it is impossible to estimate one parameter without knowing the true value of the other.

# Confounding

* A tree can be stretched back in time and explain the data with *exactly the same likelihood* if we increase the rate.
* Conversely, if we compress the tree forward in time, we obtain the same likelihood by slowing the rate down.

# Estimating the clock

* For infectious diseases, measurable evolution can occur on a time scale of weeks.
* This means that a branch of the tree can "grow" in the time between sampling different infections.

* We can use sampling times to "pin down" the tree and prevent the free-scaling problem.

# Rooting the tree

* If we are directly measuring *time*, then we must impose a direction of time's flow on the tree.
* This means that we must locate the tree's *root* (the earliest point in time).
* Rooting trees is difficult!  By definition, it is the point that is the most distant in time &mdash; it cannot be directly observed.

# Origin of HIV-1

* This concept was first used to estimate the origin date of HIV-1.
