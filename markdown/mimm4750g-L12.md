# What is a molecular clock?

<table>
  <tr>
  <td><ul>
    <li>The molecular clock is a hypothesis that evolution at a molecular level (*e.g.,* proteins) occurs at a constant rate.</li>
    <li>Based on linear relationship between the time that species diverged from their common ancestor, and the number of amino acid differences in homologous proteins (*right*).</li>
    <li>The molecular clock does *not* "tick".</li>
  </ul></td>

# Neutral theory

<table>
  <tr>
  <td><ul>
    <li>The neutral theory: "the great majority of evolutionary changes at the molecular level [...] are caused not by Darwinian selection but by random drift"</li>
    <li>Without selection, nucleotide substitutions should be a random process at a constant rate.</li>
    <li>Today, this model is denoted the "strict" clock and is seldom supported.</li>

# Testing for a clock

* If a clock exists, then sequences should become more distant from the common ancestor as a *linear trend* over time.

# Clocks and trees

* When we reconstruct a tree by fitting a model of evolution, the lengths of branches are measured in units of *expected numbers of substitutions*.

* This weird unit exists because most models are scaled to $\mu\times t$ (the rate of evolution multiplied by time).

* We say that the rate and time are *confounded* - it is impossible to estimate one parameter without knowing the true value of the other.

# Confound it!

* A tree can be stretched back in time ($\uparrow t$) and explain the data with *exactly the same likelihood* if we decrease the rate ($\downarrow \mu$).
* Conversely, if we compress the tree forward in time ($\downarrow ts$), we obtain the same likelihood by speeding up the rate ($\uparrow \mu$).

# Estimating the clock

* For infectious diseases, measurable evolution can occur on a time scale of weeks.
* This means that a branch of the tree can "grow" in the time between sampling different infections.

* We can use sampling times to "pin down" the tree and prevent the free-scaling problem.

>INCA Q1: Why doesn't this approach of "pinning down" tips of a molecular phylogeny in time work for animals like humans?

---

# Rooting the tree

* If we are directly measuring *time*, then we must impose a direction of time's flow on the tree.
* This means that we must locate the tree's *root* (the earliest point in time).
* Rooting trees is difficult!  By definition, it is the point that is the most distant in time &mdash; it cannot be directly observed.


---

# Outgroup rooting

* An *outgroup* is a species or infection that is not closely related to the sample set.
* We place the root at the point where the branch leading to the outgroup intersects the tree.
* If the outgroup is too *close*, then the root is too influenced by sampling bias (our choice of outgroup).
* If the outgroup is too *distant*, then where it intersects the tree is subject to random variation.

---

# Choosing an outgroup

* There is no objective framework to select an "optimal" outgroup.
* We often reach an informal consensus about which outgroup to use, without any other rationale.
* *e.g.*, HIV-1 subtype D is an outgroup for HIV-1.
* If an early isolate of the pathogen is available, it is sometimes used as an outgroup.
* *e.g.,* West Nile virus isolate B956 (isolated in 1940).
* **Use different outgroups to see how robust your conclusions are to choice of outgroup!**
