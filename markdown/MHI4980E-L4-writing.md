# What is scientific writing?

* Is it just writing about science?  What makes it different from regular writing?
* It is a technical report that is detailed and transparent.
  * *e.g.,* "Sequences were obtained from the cells and analyzed."
* Statements should be justified with evidence.
  * *e.g.,* "We used this method because it is the best."

---

# How is a scientific paper structured?

* Most journals expect a paper to be organized into the following sections (see [IMRaD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMRAD)):
  * Abstract
  * Introduction
  * Methods
  * Results
  * Discussion
  * References

---

# Abstract

* An abstract distills the entire paper down to its most fundamental content.
* It is often itself [structured](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/policy/structured_abstracts.html) into background, methods, results and conclusion headings.
* Most journals limit the abstract to about 200-300 words.
* An abstract should stand on its own: they usually do not include references to figures or the bibliography.
* Learning to write an effective abstract is an important skill for applying to conferences and scholarships!

---

# Introduction

* Background - what is the context of the study?  Proceed from the general to the specific.  What work has already been done?
* Define the problem - what do you want to do?
* Rationale - why is it important to do it?
* Specific aims or findings - either clarify what you want to do, or quickly summarize what you found.
* An introduction should not be excessively long.

---

# Methods

* Describes the methods used in the study with enough detail to be reproduced.
* If a program is used, provide the version number, reference and settings (at minimum, *e.g.*, "We ran program X under default settings...").
* Usually people do not describe computing hardware, unless [benchmarking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)) is an important part of the study.
* Do not present extraneous details like using a "for loop" to iterate over files.

---

# Results

* Don't underestimate the value of a good figure!
* Always report quantitative results when declaring an outcome of the study
  * *e.g.*, "many of the patients had adverse reactions to the drug" (How many exactly?  Was this number significant?).
* Do not verbally repeat data in tables or figures.
  * *e.g.,* 67 of samples were of class A, and 38 were of class B.
* Do not report numbers at a meaningless level of precision, *e.g.*, use `0.63` instead of `0.68387931487590834`

---

# Discussion

* Framing and interpreting your results in a broader context.
* Heard suggests the following scheme:
  * Interpretation of results to answer the study objectives
  * Consideration of possible weaknesses
  * Relating results to the literature, broader implications
  * Prospects for future progress
* Do not restate results - summarize and refer to material in the preceding section.

# Passive voice

<blockquote>
"EndoC-&beta;H1 cells were cultured at standard conditions in either DMEM or DMEM/F12 culture medium [...]"
</blockquote>
<small><small>Krizhanovskii *et al.*, Islets 2017, e1296995</small></small>


* The passive voice can appear to be more formal and objective, emotionally-distanced.
* Students have often been taught to write in the passive voice for scientific writing, although this norm is changing.

---

# Active voice

<blockquote>
"We cultured EndoC-&beta;H1 cells at standard conditions in either DMEM or DMEM/F12 culture medium [...]"
</blockquote>

* Writing in the active voice tends to yield more concise sentences.
* Sentences read more naturally and become more engaging for the reader.
* Most people seem to favour the active voice. *However*, using the passive voice can occasionally yield more effective sentences, and prevents a monotonous style.

---

# Grammar

* Poor grammar distracts the reader and does not convey the impression that you know what you're talking about
* Examples from Heard (2016):
  * "After thorough washing with Eliminase, epibionats were scraped from the kelp and processed for DNA amplification and sequencing"
  * "Image post-processing was required to resolve the planet from it's rings."
  * "One rat died prior to taking final blood-pressure measurements."

---

# Style

* Aspects of writing that are independent of content.
* Many aspects of style overlap between scientific and other, *e.g.*, constructing a paragraph around a specific topic.
* Transition words and phrases help with reading flow:
  * "For example", "Because", "As a result"
  * What are some others?
* Avoid informal contractions such as "it's", "they're" and "isn't"

# Common pitfalls

* Avoid repetition:
  * "I ran program X.  I took the results and then processed them with program Y.  I analyzed the final results with a linear model in R."
* Learn to recognize useless and [hedging](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe-writing-centre/develop-academic-voice/caution-hedging) words and phrases:
  * *e.g.*, "It is generally accepted that [...]"
* Make sure your conclusions are substantiated by your results.

---

# Getting started

* I find it is easiest to write the methods first.
  * Less ambiguity in describing what you did.
* Usually I write the introduction and discussion last.
* Start with an itemized list of the points you want to make before fleshing these out.
* Learn to recognize when you being fixated on a trivial detail.  Drop it and work on something else!

---

# Editing

* Sometimes I print out the paper or a section, delete the file and start over.
* It is always easier to rewrite and reduce, so try hammering out a really bad draft first!
* Avoid editing your work while you are writing it - this is an easy way to become stuck.
* Have someone review your draft - respect their feedback, even if you don't like what they have to say.
