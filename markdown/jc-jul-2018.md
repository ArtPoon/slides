## Gene birth contributes to structural disorder encoded by overlapping genes

# Overlapping genes

* A reading frame that partially or completely overlaps another reading frame
* Common in virus, bacterial, mitochrondrial genomes
* Starting to be found in eukaryotic genomes
* OvRFs, overlapping reading frames

---

# Intrinsic structural disorder
 
* Proteins that lack stable secondary, tertiary structure in absence of binding partner
* "molten globules", random coils
* experimentally measured or predicted from models
* ISD is more common in proteins encoded by overlapping genes (48% vs. 23%)

# Why is ISD more common in OvRFs?

1. ISD relieves evolutionary constraints in OvRFs [Constraint hypothesis]
2. A side-effect of gene birth (overprinting) [Facilitate Birth hypothesis]
3. A consequence of the genetic code (null model) [Genetic code hypothesis]

# Data

* Collected 102 pairs of OvRFs described in virus literature
* only 92 pairs of OvRFs available
* mostly RNA viruses (61 positive sense RNA)
* identified older member of OvRFs (parent reading frame) from literature

---

# Codon bias

* Disproportionate use of one codon over the other synonymous codons
* Thought to enhance gene expression by overloading specific tRNAs
* Another method to gauge relative ages of OvRFs
* Younger ORF expected to have less codon bias
