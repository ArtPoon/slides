# Review

* Last lecture, we talked about how computers can be used to assemble sequence fragments (reads) into the original genome.
* Genomes can range from thousands to billions of nucleotides in length.
  * The Human Genome Project took 13 years to sequence 3B nt.

---

# Genome annotation

* A genome is only useful to us if it is *annotated*.
  * Even though a human genome can now be generated in one week, annotating the human genome is an ongoing endeavour.
* Annotation bridges the gap from data (sequence) to the biology of the organism.
* The primary aim of annotation is to identify the key features of the genome.

# Process-level annotation

* Requires a widely-accepted classification scheme to describe protein functions shared by different species.
* The Gene Ontology (GO) consortium was formed by three model organism databases:
  * the [*Saccharomyces* Genome Database](https://www.yeastgenome.org/)
  * [FlyBase](https://flybase.org/)<sup>&dagger;</sup>
  * the [Mouse Genome Database](https://www.informatics.jax.org/)
* GO created a hierarchical vocabulary for describing the function of eukaryotic genes.

<small>
<sup>&dagger;</sup> A database for Drosophila genetics - recently discontinued due to US government cuts.
</small>

---

# Protein-level annotation

* Seeks to compile a definitive catalogue of proteins encoded by the genome.
* Cataloguing includes:
  * Giving each protein a unique name
  * Assigning functions to proteins
* Proteins that share a common ancestor do *not* necessarily have similar functions!
  * *e.g.*, [crystallins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallin) are proteins that make up the bulk of the eye lens, but descend from [chaperonins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperonin).

### Nucleotide-level annotation
# Non-coding RNAs

* Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) link codons in mRNA to specific amino acids during translation
  * Several tRNA prediction tools are available, *e.g.*, [tRNAscan-SE](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34417604/), [ARAGORN](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/32/1/11/1194008)
* Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are the predominant form of cellular RNA
  * Need to be removed from transcriptomic data, often one of the first steps.
  * rRNA annotation/filtering programs include [RNAmmer](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/35/9/3100/2401119) and [RiboDetector](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/50/10/e60/6533611)

### Nucleotide-level annotation
# Repetitive elements: Satellites

* About half of the human genome is associated with repetitive elements ([Stein 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35080529)).
* Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs)
  * microsatellites are repeats of 1-6 nucleotides ([Ellegrin 2004](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1348))
  * minisatellites are longer repeats of 7 to 100 nucleotides
* Repeats are a primary cause of assembly error, such that many regions in the human genome have yet to be sequenced ([de Bustos 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36665)).

---

### Nucleotide-level annotation
# Repetitive elements: Transposable elements

* [Transposable elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element) (TEs) are sequences that can change their location in the genome.
  * Retrotransposons are transcribed to RNA, reverse-transcribed back to DNA and integrated back into the genome.
  * DNA transposons are enzymatically excised and then re-inserted elsewhere in the genome.
* Many programs identify TEs by homology (*e.g.*, [RepeatMaster](https://www.repeatmasker.org/)) or structural (*e.g.*, [LTRharvest](https://www.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/forschung/gi/software/ltrharvest.html)) similarity to a database of known TEs.

### Nucleotide-level annotation
# How many genes are there?

* We tend to fixate on protein-coding genes.
* The number of genes in the human genome was thought to be as high as 100,000 in the early years of the Human Genome Project.
* Estimates fell rapidly to around 20,000 genes with more analysis.
  * Current estimates are actually lower than the number estimated for the mouse genome using the same models!
* Despite decades of research, we still do not have a definitive number - why?

---

### Nucleotide-level annotation
# How hard is it to find genes?

* *Ab initio* gene prediction from analyzing DNA is still far from perfect!
  * *Ab initio* means that the program attempts to predict features without comparing the data to other sources.
* A recent benchmark study ([Scalzitti 2020](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6707-9)) compared five widely-used gene prediction programs.
  * Tested on a large set of 1,793 eukaryotic protein-coding genes from 147 species.
  * Programs attained a sensitivity of 40%-75% and speciicity of 40%-55%.

---

### Nucleotide-level annotation
# Gene finding is hard: Genome length

* In smaller genomes (*e.g.*, prokaryotes, viruses), finding genes can be reduced to looking for long open reading frames (ORFs).
  * We assume an open reading frame consists of start and stop codons.
* Longer genomes tend to have less coding sequence:

| Species | Common name | Genome length | Coding proportion |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| *Haemophilus influenzae* | (bacterium) | 1.9 Mb | [85%](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3790081) |
| *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* | brewer's yeast | 12.1 Mb | [70%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982202005262) |
| *Drosophila melanogaster* | fruit fly | 139.5 Mb | 20%-25% |
| *Caenorhabditis elegans* | roundworm | 100 Mb | [26%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19701/#:~:text=2.3.,in%20the%20various%20titin%20isoforms.) |
| *Homo sapiens* | human | 3,200 Mb | [2%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK595930/#:~:text=Analysis%20of%20the%20assembled%20sequences,or%20other%20weak%20supporting%20evidence%E2%80%9D.) |

---

### Nucleotide-level annotation
# Gene finding is hard: Splicing

* Gene finding in longer genomes is also complicated by splicing.
* [Splicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing) is the conversion of precursor mRNA to mature transcript by removing introns.
  * An intron may induce a frameshift if it is not removed from the transcript.
  * Introns can be several thousand nucleotides in length!
  * Imaging doing a [word search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_search) when any number of random letters can be placed within each word.
* [Alternative splicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing) means that more than one protein can be derived from the same gene.

---

### Nucleotide-level annotation
# Gene finding is hard: Pseudogenes

* Pseudogenes are usually duplicate, redundant copies of an ancestral gene.
  * Eventually the copy accumulates so many mutations that it no longer encodes a functional protein.
* Because they are derived from actual genes, pseudogenes are a source of false positives.
* In some cases, a pseudogene *regains* novel functionality.
  * Many pseudogenes display organ-specific transcription levels.

---

# Gene finding: software

* There are MANY computer programs that have been developed for gene finding:

| Program | Published  | Program | Published | 
|---------|------------|---------|-----------|
| GENSCAN | 1997       | Fgenes | 1995 | 
| Genie | 1996         | HMMGene | 1997 |
| GeneMark.hmm | 1999  | GlimmerM, Exonomy, Unveil | 2003 |
| Grail | 1991         | AUGUSTUS | 2018 |
| HEXON | 1994         | Helixer | 2020 | 
| MZEF | 1997         | Tiberius | 2024 | 

* The majority of these have used hidden Markov models (HMMs)

# How do we identify the unseeable?

* A genome sequence is a long string of letters:

`AGCTTGGACTGTGATGCTAGTGCGAGCAGCGTTGCTAGTCCCGGCTGATGTC`

* Usually, a feature has no characteristics that *unambiguously* reveal its presence.
  * *e.g.*, a protein-coding gene is generally flanked by start (`ATG`) and stop (`TAA/TAG/TGA`) codons, but those can appear anywhere!
* We need to have some kind of model for the *probability* that a feature is there.

---

# What are hidden Markov models?

* A majority of genome annotations programs for identifying nucleotide-level features have used hidden Markov models (HMMs).
  * You may have noticed that many program names contain the abbreviation "HMM"
* A hidden Markov model is a machine learning method from the field of [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing).
  * NLP is the study of making computers "understand" a language that does not follow consistent rules.

---

# Remember Markov models?

* A stochastic process is a model that describes the probability that a system is in some state $X$ at time $t$.
  * It has the Markov property if that probability depends *only* on its state at a previous time $s<t$.
  * The board game [Candy Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Land) has the Markov property.
* We last talked about Markov models in our [lecture](https://slides.filogeneti.ca/html/mbi3100-L05-distances.html#/11) on genetic distances.
* HMMs have the Markov property.

---

# Latent states

* HMMs are "hidden" because they are models of states that cannot be directly observed.
  * A variable with hidden states is as [latent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_and_observable_variables).
  * Happiness cannot be directly measured, but it exists and can be modeled as a hidden state.
* An HMM assumes that latent states have different probabilities of *emitting* observable states. 

---

# Example

* Imagine we have a machine that drops blue or red balls at random $(p_0=0.5)$ as it moves along a track.
* Sometimes $(q_{01}=0.2)$ the mechanism gets stuck and it rarely drops blue $(p_1=0.9)$.
  * It also gets unstuck with probability $q_{10}=0.1$.
* Suppose that the state of the mechanism is hidden to us (it is sealed inside the machine).
  * Can we deduce the hidden state at any time, given the sequence of balls it has dropped?

In this example, the true sequence of hidden states (top) has a higher log-likelihood than a system that stays in hidden state 0:

# How do we solve it?

* The [Viterbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Viterbi) algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the most likely sequence (of length `T`) of `N` hidden states, given a sequence of observed states $\\{x_{t=1\ldots T}\\}$.
* Requires the model parameters, *i.e.*, initial, transition and emission probabilities.

<small>Abbreviated pseudocode for the Viterbi algorithm</small>
<pre><code data-trim class="language-Python">
for each state i from 1..N do  # initialization step
    V[i,1] = pi[i] * emit[i][obs[1]]

        V[i,t] = max{j=1..N; V(j,t-1) * q(j,i) * P(x_t | i)}
        # also store info for tracing the best path here

bestpath = argmax{i=1..N; V[i,T]}  # termination
</code></pre>

# Baum-Welch algorithm

* A method to solve for the unknown parameters of an HMM, *i.e.*, $\Theta=\\{\pi, Q, P\\}$.
* Uses the [expectation-maximization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm), an approach that alternates between:
  1. solving for the best states for hidden variables, given the current $\Theta$, and;
  2. using those states to obtain better estimates for $\Theta$
* For HMMs, we use the Viterbi algorithm for step (1).

---

# Training HMMs

* The Baum-Welch algorithm is an [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) learning method - we do not know what the hidden states are.
  * This is useful when dealing with novel genomes and/or features.
* We can take a [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) approach if we provide labeled training data, *i.e.*, where the locations of genes are specified.
  * This requires a very well-characterized genome with experimental validation.
  * We will have problems if the genes are different than those in the test data.

# Genome annotation projects

* [RefSeqGene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/rsg/) is a subset of the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) project with the mission of annotating genomes with well-characterized genes as reference standards.
  * Establishes conventions for numbering gene exons and introns.

* The [GENCODE]() project endeavours to "identify and classify all gene features in the human and mouse genomes"
  * All project data is open access and can be accessed by FTP or using a web-based [genome browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_browser).
