# Bayesian inference

* We spent the previous lecture and lab talking about and learning work with Bayesian methods.
* Bayesian inference is extremely useful for dealing with complex models like *trees*.
* A tree is a model that is made up of branching patterns and branch lengths.  This is a lot of parameters!
* The MLE of the tree is only one point in a *massive* space of all possible trees.

# Priors on trees

* We've learned about priors on continuous variables.  There are also priors for discrete variables.
* What about trees?
* We'd need some way of arranging trees along a meaningful axis in order to draw a prior distribution the usual way.
