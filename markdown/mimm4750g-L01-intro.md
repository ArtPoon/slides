# Policy on deadlines

* Any assignment will receive a **grade of zero** if it is submitted after the deadline, with the exception of academic accommodation and self-reported absences.
* In the case of accommodation or SRA, the assignment is due 72 hours after the deadline (48 hours accommodation + 24 hours).  For example, an assignment is due on 5pm of March 1st is due on 5pm of March 4th with accommodation.
* **There are no make-up labs.**  The total grade value of a missed lab with accommodation/SRA will be re-allocated to the next lab - if the student misses the last lab, the grade will be re-allocated to the final project.
