# Likelihood

* Recall that likelihood is focusing on the probability as a function of the model parameters (hypothesis) given the data.
* For a given data set, we want to find the parameters that maximize the likelihood of our model.
* This is quite powerful! 

---

# Objections to maximum likelihood

* The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is a single combination of parameter values.
* If the likelihood function is "rugged", then there may be many parameter values that are about as good as the MLE!

---

# Being Bayesian

* A Bayesian would object to relying on a single estimate
* It is more robust to refer to the *distribution* of parameters that are supported by the data.
* A Bayesian would also object to the assumption that the experiment is completely objective.
* The design of an experiment is shaped by an investigator's subjective expectations about the outcome.

# Conditional probability

* We are used to thinking about the probability of an outcome, $P(D)$.
* This implicitly involves some model (hypothesis), $P(D|H)$.
* We say that $P(D|H)$ is "the probability of the data, conditional on the hypothesis being true".
<img src="/img/conditional.png" width="500px"/>

---

# Joint probability

* We can calculate the **joint probability** that both D and H are true:
  <img src="/img/conditional2.png"/>

  $$P(D,H) = P(D|H) \times P(H)$$

* It's perfectly valid to swap D and H!

  $$P(D,H) = P(H|D) \times P(D)$$

---

# Bayes' theorem

* This leads to something outrageous and wonderful:

---

# Belief

* This formula has some strange quantities.
* $P(D|H)$ is the likelihood.
* $P(D)$ is the probability of the data. *Weird.*
* $P(H)$ is the probability of the hypothesis without any data.
* If we have no data, then we can only work with our *prior belief*.
* $P(H|D)$ is then our updated belief *after we have seen the data*.  It is the posterior belief.


---

# Reasons why people don't like Bayes' theorem

* "Belief doesn't seem scientific."
* "How am I supposed to decide what my prior belief is?"
* "The prior is biasing your study."
* Too much weird math.

# Getting rid of P(D)

* We could calculate $P(D)$ exactly by integrating $P(D|H)$ over *all possible hypotheses*:
  $$P(D) = \int_H P(D|H) P(H)$$

* It is often not possible to solve for this integral.
* We need to take a different approach...

---

# What do we *really* want?

* We *really* want to know what the posterior distribution $P(H|D)$ looks like.
* For example, what is the *mean* or *median* value?  (What is our best guess about the true value of $H$?)
* Usually, $P(H|D)$ cannot be written down as a mathematical formula.
* The next best thing would be a random sample of values $H$ from $P(H|D)$.

# Markov chain Monte Carlo

* A random walk is basically a simulation.  If we use a random walk to solve a problem, we are using a *Monte Carlo method*.
* Remember a *Markov chain* is a random process where the probability of the next event depends only on the current state (like Snakes and Ladders).
* Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a powerful method to solve problems in a Bayesian framework.

---

# Metropolis-Hastings sampling

* Remember that $P(D)$ is a difficult integral to deal with.
* What if we consider the ratio of $P(H|D)$ for two hypotheses, $H$ and $H'$?  Then $P(D)$ cancels out!
* M-H sampling is a random walk over the space of model parameters $(H)$.  
* We *propose* a new set of parameters $H'$, and then decide whether to accept this proposal.

---

# Metropolis-Hastings sampling

* Our random walk is controlled by this ratio:
  
  $$
  R = \frac{Q(H'|H)}{Q(H|H')} \times \frac{P(D|H')P(H')}{P(D|H) P(H)}
  $$
  
  where $Q(y|x)$ is the probability of proposing $y$ when you are at $x$.
* Remember that $P(H|D) \propto P(D|H)P(H)$.

---

# Metropolis-Hastings sampling
* It turns out that if you follow these rules:
  1. Always accept the proposed $H'$ if $R\ge 1$.
  2. If $R<1$, accept $H'$ anyways with probability $R$.
  
     This means we take a "step down"!
  3. Otherwise, stay where we are with $H$.

* then the amount of time our random walk spends in $H$ will be proportional to the posterior probability $P(H|D)$.

# Convergence

* MCMC is an "auto-correlated" process - the current state will always be similar to the previous state.
* This is *efficient* because we don't waste time sampling states (parameter values) that are silly.
* This is *not efficient* because a random walk is slow to explore parameter space.
* When a random walk has gone long enough, it should eventually "converge" to the posterior distribution.

---

# Burn-in and thinning

* What if the random walk starts in an awful part of parameter space?
* We don't want this to affect the sample, so we throw out the first part of the walk (chain).
* To reduce auto-correlation the sample, we only keep a small number of samples taken from equal intervals along the chain (thinning).
