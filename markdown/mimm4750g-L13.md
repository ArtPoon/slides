# Likelihood

* Recall that likelihood is focusing on the probability as a function of the model parameters (hypothesis) given the data.
* For a given data set, we want to find the parameters that maximize the likelihood of our model.
* This is quite powerful! 

---

# Objections to maximum likelihood

* The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is a single combination of parameter values.
* If the likelihood function is "rugged", then there may be many parameter values that are about as good as the MLE!

---

# Being Bayesian

* A Bayesian would object to relying on a single estimate
* It is more robust to refer to the *distribution* of parameters that are supported by the data.
* A Bayesian would also object to the assumption that the experiment is completely objective.
* The design of an experiment is shaped by an investigator's subjective expectations about the outcome.

# Conditional probability

* We are used to thinking about the probability of an outcome, $P(D)$.
* This implicitly involves some model (hypothesis), $P(D|H)$.
* We say that $P(D|H)$ is "the probability of the data, conditional on the hypothesis being true".

---

# Joint probability

* We can calculate the **joint probability** that both D and H are true:
  <img src="/img/conditional2.png"/>

  $$P(D,H) = P(D|H) \times P(H)$$

* It's perfectly valid to swap D and H!

  $$P(D,H) = P(H|D) \times P(D)$$

---

# Bayes' theorem

* This leads to something outrageous and wonderful:

# Belief

* This formula has some strange quantities.
* $P(D|H)$ is the likelihood.
* $P(D)$ is the probability of the data. *Weird.*
* $P(H)$ is the probability of the hypothesis without any data.
* If we have no data, then we can only work with our *prior belief*.
* $P(H|D)$ is then our updated belief *after we have seen the data*.  It is the posterior belief.


---

# Reasons why people don't like Bayes' theorem

* "Belief doesn't seem scientific."
* "How am I supposed to decide what my prior belief is?"
* "The prior is biasing your study."
* Too much weird math.

# Getting rid of P(D)

* We could calculate $P(D)$ exactly by integrating $P(D|H)$ over *all possible hypotheses*:
  $$P(D) = \int_H P(D|H) P(H)$$

* It is often not possible to solve for this integral.
