# Probability and bioinformatics

* A significant part of bioinformatics is figuring out how to fit a model to the data.
  * We use models to represent a hypothesis or "way of understanding the world".
  * Models allow us to extrapolate unseen values, *e.g.*, to make predictions.
* A *probabilistic* model assigns a chance of some random outcome occuring.
  * The outcome values are *variables*.

---

# Outcome spaces

* To understand probability, it helps to think about the *outcome space* (sometimes denoted as $\Omega$).
* Think of the largest box of a [Venn diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram) as representing *all* possible outcomes.
* We can partition this space into sections representing *discrete* or *continuous* outcomes.

# Properties of a probability distribution

* A [probability distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) (PDF) is a function that maps from an outcome space to a probability, $f: \Omega \rightarrow p$.
* A PDF *must* sum to 1 (100%) across all possible outcomes, *for a given hypothesis* or parameter settings.
  * For a continuous PDF, we integrate over a range of values.

# Binomial probability

* What is the probability of getting 5 heads in 10 coin tosses?
  * Let the probability of heads is $p$ &mdash; this is a *parameter* (hypothesis).
  * Let the number of heads ($y=5$) and tosses ($N=10$) be our *data*.
* Let's make some assumptions:
  1. My coin tossing is truly random.
  2. The coin tosses are independent - one result does not influence another.
  3. $p$ is constant - the coin and my tossing action do not change.

---

# Binomial distribution

* The probability of the data $\\{N,y\\}$ given the hypothesis $\\{p\\}$ can be described by the *binomial model*:
`$$P(N,y\;|\;p) = {N\choose y} p^y (1-p)^{(N-y)}$$`
* ${N\choose y}$ is shorthand for $\frac{N!}{(N-y)!y!}$, where $N!=N\times(N-1)\times(N-2)\times \ldots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$.

# Stochastic processes

* A [stochastic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process) is a model that describes how a system changes over time, as a series of random outcomes, $\\{X_i\\}$ for $i=\\{1, 2, 3, \ldots\\}$.
* Many biological processes are modeled as stochastic processes, such as:
  * The evolution of a DNA sequence over time.
  * The transmission of an infectious disease from one host to the next.
  * The convergence of lineages to common ancestors back in time.

---

# Random walks

* A [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) is a stochastic process that starts with $X_0=0$ and:
$$
X_{t+1} = \begin{cases}
X_{t} - 1 & \text{with probability 0.5}\\\\
X_{t} + 1 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$
* A PDF of $X_t$ can be obtained from a binomial distribution where $N=t$ (the number of steps) and $p=0.5$.

      <ul>
        <li> If the Markov chain can only take a finite number of states, then we can write the probabilities of transitions between states as a matrix:

        \hline
        \raisebox{-1em}{\textrm{from:}} & E & 0.3 & 0.7\\

        <li>Note each row* must sum to one &mdash; the chain must go <i>somewhere</i>.</li>
        <li>This matrix is often denoted as $P$ because it contains transition probabilities.</li>

# Stationary distributions

* The transition matrix $P$ tells us how to move from one state to another, but what if we don't know our starting state?
* Suppose we track the frequencies that different states occur in the Markov chain.
  * For some Markov chains, these frequencies will converge to an equilibrium called the [stationary distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time_Markov_chain#Stationary_distributions).
* If we have no other information, then the stationary distribution represents our best guess about the initial state.

---

# Stationary distributions (2)
* More formally, the stationary distribution is a probability vector $\pi$ such that $\pi P = \pi$ and $\sum\pi = 1$.
* Let's solve for the stationary distribution:

`$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\pi_E & \pi_A \\
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\pi_E & \pi_A \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
0.3 & 0.7 \\
0.4 & 0.6 \\
\end{pmatrix}\\[6pt]
\hspace{9.2em} = \begin{pmatrix}
0.3\pi_E+0.4\pi_A & 0.7\pi_E+0.6\pi_A \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$`

`$$
\pi_E + \pi_A = 1 \implies 0.3\pi_E + 0.4(1-\pi_E) = \pi_E\\[6pt]
\pi_E = 0.4/1.1 = 0.\overline{36}\\
\pi_A = 1 - 0.\overline{36} = 0.\overline{63}
$$`

* A probability distribution can be discrete or continuous.
* The Poisson distribution describes the probability that $Y$ events occur within time $t$ at rate $\lambda$.
* A random walk is a model describing a path resulting from a series of random steps in some space.
* A Markov chain is type of stochastic process in which the probability of the next change depends only on the current state.
