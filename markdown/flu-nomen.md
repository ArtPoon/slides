* The influenza A virus (IAV) genome comprises 8 segments, numbered in decreasing order by length.

* IAV infections are frequently classified into HnNn subtypes based on hemagglutinin (HA, 4) and neuraminidase (NA, 6).

# IAV subtypes

* HA and NA are partitioned into 18 and 11 subtypes, respectively.
* Historically, subtypes were defined by antigenic characteristics, *e.g.*, double immuno-diffusion assays.

* Provisional subtype H19 was described in 2023 from a partial HA sequence isolated from a diving duck in Kazakhstan.
