# Substitution Rates

* We measure rate of evolution by the number of substitutions per site per unit time.
* A substitution occurs when a new mutation appears *and* increases in frequency until it is established in the population.
* **Individuals do not evolve, populations do.**

# Mutation rates

* The rate of evolution is limited by the input of new mutations.
* RNA viruses encode a reverse transcriptase that lacks proof-reading ability.

# Why do rates matter?
* Sites that evolve faster than others can reveal targets of selection.
* Rate of evolution may determine which variant survives.
* We can use the rate of evolution to extrapolate back in time.

# Substitution models

* The Jukes-Cantor model can be expressed by the following rate matrix:

$$ \left( \begin{matrix}
  \ast & \mu & \mu & \mu \\\\
  \mu & \ast & \mu & \mu \\\\
  \mu & \mu & \ast & \mu \\\\
  \mu & \mu & \mu & \ast \\
  \end{matrix}\right)$$

* The diagonal entries $\ast$ are set to $-3\mu$ so that each row sums to 0.

<!--


# Rates into probabilities

* To convert this rate matrix into the probability that $X$ transitions into $Y$ after time $t$, we have to use *matrix exponentiation*.
* This is a computationally costly operation that accounts for all possible transitions that may occur in time $t$.
* For a rate matrix $Q$, the probability matrix is:

  $$P(t) = \exp^{Q t}$$
* This is where the confounding of rate and time appears.
-->

# Other models

* The Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY85) model allows for unequal base frequencies ($\pi_i$) and a transition/transversion rate bias ($\kappa$).

$$\begin{matrix}
 & \begin{matrix}A\;&\;C\;&\;G\;&\;T\end{matrix} \\\\
\begin{matrix}A\\\\C\\\\G\\\\T\end{matrix} &
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \ast & \kappa \pi_C & \pi_G & \kappa\pi_T\\\\
    \kappa\pi_A & \ast & \kappa\pi_G & \pi_T\\\\
    \pi_A & \kappa\pi_C & \ast & \kappa\pi_T\\\\
    \kappa\pi_A & \pi_C & \kappa\pi_G & \ast
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{matrix}$$

---

# Generalized models

* In general, there are six rates for a time-reversible (symmetric rates) model:

  $$ \left( \begin{matrix}
  \ast & a & b & c \\\\
  a & \ast & d & e \\\\
  b & d & \ast & f \\\\
  c & e & f & \ast \\
  \end{matrix}\right)$$

  where these rates are assigned in alphabetical order &mdash; $a$ is the rate from `$A\leftrightarrow C$`, $b$ is `$A\leftrightarrow G$`, etc.

# Model specification

* PAUP* was a popular commercial software package for reconstructing phylogenies.
* It used a six-digit number ($abcdef$) to represent any kind of time-reversible nucleotide substitution model:
* *e.g.,* HKY85 becomes 010010.
* This scheme is still used by other software, such as HyPhy and PhyML.

---

# Why does the model matter?

* There are an enormous number of possible time-reversible models of nucleotide substitution.
* Using the wrong model (*model misspecification*) can bias estimates of other model parameters, *e.g.,* reconstructing the correct tree.
* The process of figuring out which model is best supported by the data is called *model selection*.

---

# Model selection

* We want to choose the model that has the best fit to the data.
* Adding parameters to the model improves the fit.
* We need to justify additional parameters!

# Likelihood ratio test

* The *likelihood ratio test* (LRT) is a method of model selection that applies when one model is a special case of another.
* *e.g.,* the JC69 model is a special case of HKY85 where $\kappa=1$.
* If the likelihood of model 1 is $L_1$ and model 2 is $L_2$, then this test statistic:
  $$-2\log\left(\frac{L_1}{L_2}\right) = -2(\log L_1 - \log L_2)$$
  follows a $\chi^2_k$ distribution.
* $k$ is the difference in the number of parameters.

---

# &chi;-squared distribution

---

# Nested models



---

# Akaike information criterion

* What if the models are not nested?
* The Akaike information criterion (AIC) penalizes the model's likelihood by the number of parameters

* *There is no statistical distribution*!  The best model minimizes the AIC.

  $$\text{AIC} = 2k - 2\log(L)$$
