# Gene expression

* So far we have focused predominantly on genetic sequence variation.
* Biological diversity stems not only from our genomes, but how those genomes are "read".


---

# Transcriptomics

* Characterizing gene expression through messenger RNAs
* Microarrays - hybridization of mRNAs to probes
* Sequencing - direct determination of mRNA sequence as complementary DNA (cDNA)
* Next-generation sequencing of total RNA
  * Sample enrichment for mRNAs via polyA tails.

---

# Splice junctions

* The boundaries between introns and exons
* [Alternative splicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing) - varying the exon composition to generate multiple mRNAs from the same transcript.
