# Untargeted sequencing

* If we can't use template-specific primers, what *can* we do?
* Find a conserved region &mdash; shared across all, if not most &mdash; species, for amplification: but the region in between should be non-conserved!
* [Random priming](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/2/3/185.short) - suppliers will generate short oligos (*e.g.*, hexamers) of random nucleotides.
* Both amplification and priming can lead to biases.
