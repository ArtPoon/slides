# Talks and posters

* In science, knowledge dissemination largely occurs by:
  1. publishing papers and;
  2. by presentations at scientific meetings.
* Presentations are either *oral* ("talk") or *poster* formats.
* A poster presentation consists of a single, large printout.  
  * Resembles the "science fair" format.
  * The presenter uses their poster as a visual aid while talking to other conference attendees.

# A brief history of visual aids

* Scientific talks used to employ [slide photographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversal_film) or overhead projectors

# PowerPoint

* Early "slideware" program attributed to [Whitfield Diffie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie) at Bell-Northern Research Laboratories (1970s).
* Created by [Bob Gaskins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gaskins) at a now defunct Silicon Valley company, exclusively for the Apple Macintosh, first release 1987.
* Acquired by Microsoft in the same year, becomes the dominant medium for presenting slides.

# How much text?

> For the naive, bullet lists may create the appearance of hard-headed organized thought.<br/>&mdash; Edward Tufte

| Quantity | Label | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| Most | The wall of text | Easy to copy-paste | Tremendously difficult, pointless for the audience |
|  | Somewhere in between | To the point | Room for error |
| Least | The TED talk | Focuses attention on your speaking | Often not feasible for science |

---

# Text styling

* Your text should be large enough to read from the back of the room.
* Many of your audience members will be myopic &mdash; small text makes them grouchy!
  * <small><small><small>When I see slides like this, I get mad.</small></small></small>
* Try to stick to a consistent font.  Use **bold** and *italic* faces sparingly.
* For a fresh look, try [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).  Avoid handwritten, condensed and thin styles.

---

# Phluff

* Tufte's term for "chartjunk, over-produced layouts, cheerleader logotypes and branding, and corny clip art".

# Transitions and animations

* Slide "builds" can be overused and get distracting.
* Builds may require you to use several times as many mouse- or key-clicks to move between slides.
* Animations, used sparingly, can be effective and memorable!

---

# Duration

* Usually between 15 minutes (conference) to 1 hour (seminar).
  * Your presentations for this course will be 20 minutes, with 10 minutes for questions.
* Avoid speaking too quickly to cram in more material - it is better to throw things out.
* Write down a list of the most important points (background, rationale, methods, results, concluding remarks) before making your slides.

---

# The outline slide

* Some people strongly advocate using an outline slide near the start of your talk, and revisiting it between sections.
* I don't like the outline slide, *but* I have seen a "progress bar" approach used effectively.

---

# Use informative titles

<br/>
<center>
<b>T cell frequencies not different between clinical groups</b>

  is better than

<b>Results: Flow cytometry</b>
</center>

* Make sure your title is easily distinguishable from the rest of the text.

---

# Speaking

* Avoid reading from a prepared script - it prevents you from speaking in a natural and engaging way
* Avoid reading off your slide *ab vertbatim*.  
  * On the other hand, if you are saying something different from the text, then the audience has to *read* and *listen* at the same time!
  * A compromise is to use your slide like a "[cue card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_card)".

---

# Speaking (2)
* Make eye contact.
  * Don't talk to the screen.
  * Find the audience member who is smiling and nodding.

---

# Equipment

* Always show up early to set up and test your equipment in the room.
* Bring spare cables and dongles if you have 'em.
* Keep a copy of your slides on a USB dongle or e-mail them to yourself.
