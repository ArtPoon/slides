## Data formats

---

# Why formats?

* Data that has been generated by equipment or retrieved from a database is written to a file in a particular configuration (format).
* We need to have formats so that data can be read from a file in a consistent way.

---

# Tabular data

* Tables are a fundamental mode of organizing data
* Rows represent observations
* Columns represent variables

# Comma-separated values (CSV)

* A common format for writing tabular data to a text file.
* Each row appears on a separate line.
* Values are separated by a reserved symbol (delimiter)
* If the value contains the delimiter, enclose the value in quotes.

```CSV
