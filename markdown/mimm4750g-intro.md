# Independent project

* This is an [essay course](https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/registration_progression_grad/coursenumbering.pdf)!

* Written assessments will be reports about an independent project.

* You are responsible for *independently* collecting data, analyzing it using methods we learn in this course, and preparing a written report.

* [TurnItIn](https://elearningtoolkit.uwo.ca/tools/TurnItIn.html) *will* be used to assess written assignments.

# Expectations about AI

* Assessment will place greater weight on methods and results than introduction.
* Analyses must be run on the course server (mbilabs-02.schulich.uwo.ca).
* Your data and workflow on the server should be organized and documented.
* Your reports must contain at least one figure.

# "I'm worried about coding"

* This course has no prerequisites in computer science - you will not have to write any of your own code.
* *However*, you will need to become comfortable with the command line interface.
* Reviewing the **UNIX and Markdown guide and quick reference** is *strongly recommended*.

# What is bioinformatics?

* Bioinformatics is the use of computers to manage and analyze biological data.
* New lab technologies can produce overwhelming amounts of data.
* Much of bioinformatics concerns genetic sequence data, although there are other important domains (structural data, imaging data).

# Bioinformatics and infectious disease

* Infectious diseases (viruses, bacteria, and single-celled eukaryotes) are often characterized by sequence alone.
* We can learn a lot about an infection by comparing its sequence to other sequences.
* Reconstructing a tree connecting sequences to their common ancestors back in time can tell us about the origin and spread of an infectious disease.
