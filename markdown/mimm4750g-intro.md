# Policy on deadlines

* Any assignment will receive a **grade of zero** if it is submitted after the deadline, with the exception of academic accommodation and self-reported absences.

* In the case of academic accommodation, the assignment must be submitted **within 48 hours** of the original deadline.

* **There are no make-up labs.**   With accommodation, the total grade value of a missed lab with accommodation will be re-allocated to the next lab, or to the final project (in case of last assignment).

# Evaluation

* Lab assignments (50%)
  * Practical application of topics covered in class on remote server or home desktop (via web apps)

* Draft report (15%)
  * Proposal of independent project (&geq; 500 words).  
  * Background, rationale, proposed data sources and methods.  

* Independent project report (35%)
  * Final report of project, written in form of a scientific paper (&geq; 2,000 words).
  * Background, rationale, data sources and methods, results and discussion.

# Evaluation

* No virtual proctoring will be used.
* Written assignments will be submitted to Turnitin
* Grading rubrics will be provided for both written assignments.
* Late assignments *without illness self-reports* will be subject to a 10%/day penalty.

# What is bioinformatics?

* Bioinformatics is the use of computing and statistics to solve problems in biology.
  * Automation, high performance computing
  * Data curation and management
  * Analysis of complex data (e.g., sequences)
* Rapid growth driven by the widespread adoption of high-throughput technologies like next-generation sequencing.
