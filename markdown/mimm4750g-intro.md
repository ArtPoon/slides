# Independent project

* This is an [essay course](https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/registration_progression_grad/coursenumbering.pdf)!

* Written assessments will be reports about an independent project.
  * Please do not start your project at the last minute!

* You are responsible for *independently* collecting data and analyzing it using the methods that you will learn in this course.

* [TurnItIn](https://elearningtoolkit.uwo.ca/tools/TurnItIn.html) *will* be used to assess written assignments.

# "I'm worried about coding"

* This course has no prerequisites in computer science.
* **You will not have to write any of your own code.**
* *However*, you will need to become comfortable with the [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).
* Reviewing the [introduction to UNIX](https://westernu.brightspace.com/d2l/le/lessons/68221/topics/2639285) is *strongly recommended*.

# The course server

* A server funded by the UWO SSC's [Science Student Donation](https://www.uwo.ca/sci/counselling/procedures/science_student_donation.html) initiative.
  * Two AMD EPYC 64-core CPUs
  * 1.5 TB of RAM
  * Running Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)
* Access is restricted to students enrolled in the course.
* Usage is monitored!  You may **not** use this server for any tasks unrelated to this course.

# What is bioinformatics?

* Bioinformatics is the use of computers to manage and analyze biological data.
  * Driven by unprecedented amount of data produced by the Human Genome Project.
* New lab technologies can produce overwhelming amounts of data.
  * *e.g.*, a NextSeq 550 benchtop system can produce about four human genomes (assuming 10x coverage) in about 24 hours.
* Much of bioinformatics concerns genetic sequence data, although there are other important domains (structural data, imaging data).

---

# Bioinformatics and infectious disease

* Infectious diseases (viruses, bacteria, and single-celled eukaryotes) are often characterized by sequence alone.
* We can learn a lot about an infection by comparing its sequence to other sequences.
* We can reconstruct a tree that connects sequences to their common ancestors back in time.
  * Trees can be used to learn about the origin and spread of an infectious disease.

# NCBI Genbank

* One of the most important resources for sequence data is the NCBI Genbank database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank).
<img src="/img/genbank.png" width="600px">
* Mirrored by:
  * the European Nucleotide Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home)

# Genbank format

* A very complex format that contains a diverse amount of information:

# Command line interface (CLI)

* The CLI is a text-based method of issuing directives to a computer.
* Simple programs can be combined by the user in unlimited ways to perform complex tasks.
* Most bioinformatic methods must be run using the CLI.
  * Developing a graphical user interface (GUI) is a time-consuming process.
* High-performance computing systems are usually accessed remotely over a network using a CLI.
  * *e.g.*, Compute Canada, Amazon Web Services (AWS).

# UNIX-like operating systems

* UNIX is an OS that was developed for remote computing on a shared system.
* GNU/Linux is an open-source re-implementation of UNIX.
  * About 62% of servers around the world run GNU/Linux.
  * About 45% of mobile phones use Android/Linux.
  * There are many distributions of GNU/Linux including [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) and [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).
* Don't forget to complete the Unit 1 readings and quiz!

<h1 style="color:white">Key points</h1>


* Bioinformatics plays an essential role in our understanding of &mdash; and our ability to manage and treat &mdash; infectious diseases.
* This course will teach you to use DNA sequences to reconstruct how an epidemic has spread and adapted to new hosts.
* Most bioinformatics is performed with a command-line interface.
* Please do the Unit 1 readings, *especially* if you haven't taken MBI 3100A!
