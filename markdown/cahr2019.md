# Clusters in genetic space

* Spatial clustering may be less useful for pathogens that are transmitted by intimate contact.

* HIV-1 evolves so rapidly that the virus infection becomes unique to each person within months.

* A group of people diagnosed with HIV-1 that are genetically similar may have been affected by an outbreak.

* Routine genotyping presents an opportunity to detect outbreaks in "near real time".

---

# Protect people

* Genetic clustering has also been misused as forensic evidence in HIV-1 transmission cases.

<center><h2>HIV is not a crime.</h2><center> 

* Clustering must be done in a way that **does not add risk to individuals**, while providing a measurable benefit for public health.

* Reach out to groups without targeting the individual.

---

# Are genetic clusters helpful?

* If we are going to use genetic clustering to guide public health decisions in "near real time"...

* ... we need to be able to evaluate whether genetic clusters can help us make better decisions.

> Our aim is to develop a new statistical framework where it is possible to evaluate a clustering method against any other method of prioritizing groups.

---

# Pairwise clustering

* We start by analyzing the simplest method.

* **Pairwise distance clustering** is a popular approach that builds up clusters from pairs of sequences (*e.g.,* [HIV-TRACE](https://github.com/veg/hivtrace)).

* This threshold is often entirely arbitrary!

* (Some studies have used **longitudinal HIV-1 divergence** &mdash; how far a patient's own virus population may evolve &mdash; to select a threshold, *e.g.*, B.C.)

---

# Optimizing the cutoff

* The genetic distance is affected as much by when a person's infection is **diagnosed** as when they were **infected**$^{1,2}$.

* There is no such thing as a "gold standard" cutoff for all settings.

* If the cutoff is too relaxed (high), then nearly all HIV-1 sequences will appear in a single giant cluster.

* Too strict (low), then every sequence is a cluster of one.

# The modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP)

* This is a common problem in spatial statistics.

* Statistical associations depend on how you partition geographic space into units of observation.

# MAUP and HIV clustering

* We propose to draw an analogy between geography and **genetic space**.

* Na&iuml;vely using some cutoff for HIV clustering is equivalent to ignoring how different boundaries can be drawn on a map.

* How can we justify using one set of boundaries instead of another?

> We propose that the best criteria to select a clustering method is our ability to predict where the next cases will occur.

# Prediction models

* A cutoff defines a partition of known cases into clusters $\{C_i\}$

* The number of new cases with sufficient similarity to $C_i$ is a Poisson-distributed outcome.
<img src="/img/maup/drawing-1.svg"/>

<center><h2>Similarity does not imply transmission.</h2></center>

---

# Prediction models

* Let the predicted number of new cases adjacent (similar) to the $i$-th cluster be:
`$$\hat{R}(C_i) = \exp\left(\alpha +  \beta \sum_{v\in C_i}{\rho(v)} \right)$$`

* In other words, the predicted "growth" of a cluster obtained by summing over all members of the group.

* $\rho(v)$ is the *weight* of an individual vertex representing a known case

* $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are parameters to be estimated by Poisson regression

---

# Similarity as a function of case recency

* The weight of a known case $\rho$ can be any linear combination of individual attributes $A(v)$ 

* For demonstration, we use a single attribute based on the sample collection date $t(v)$.

* If new cases appear in time interval $t_{\max}$, then we calculate the expected weight of known case $v$ from its recency as follows:

`$$\log\left(\frac{\hat{\rho}}{1-\hat{\rho}}\right) = \alpha + \beta_0 \left(t(v)-t_{\max}\right)$$`

---

# Datasets

* We obtained two published data sets of anonymized HIV-1 *pol* sequences collected in Seattle$^1$ ($n=1,591$) and Northern Alberta$^2$ ($n=803$).
* $n=110$ "new cases" in last year of sampling (2012, 2013).

# The effect of varying cutoffs

  <tr>
  <td>
  <ul>
    <li>The number of new cases adjacent to clusters declines with lower cutoffs.</li>
    <li>Represents upper limit to how many clusters gain a new case.</li>
    <li>The number of these "active clusters" has an intermediate optimum.</li>
    <li>At relaxed cutoffs, all known cases are grouped into one giant cluster.</li>
  </ul>
  </td>

# Model comparison

* We optimize the distance cutoff by comparing our model against a null model:
`$$\hat{R}_0(C_i) = \exp\left(\frac{|C_i|}{|V^c|}R\right)$$`

* $|C_i|$ is the number of known cases in the $i$-th cluster
* $|V^c|$ is the total number of known cases
* $R$ is the total number of new cases that are adjacent to clusters
* This null model assumes that cluster growth is proportionate to cluster size.

---

# An information criterion

* Nakaya$^1$ describes a "generalized Akaike information criterion" (GAIC) to select the optimum partition of a region into districts.

* It is simply the difference in AIC:

`$$\begin{eqnarray}\text{GAIC} & = & \text{AIC}(\hat{R}) - \text{AIC}(\hat{R}_0) \nonumber \\& = & 2(k - k_0) - 2\left(\log L(\hat{R}) - \log L(\hat{R}_0)\right)\end{eqnarray}$$`

* The optimal cutoff minimizes the GAIC.

# Results

<table>
  <tr>
  <td>
  <ul>
    <li>When cutoff is high, most known cases are in one large cluster; the weighted model is no different from the null model (GAIC near 0)</li>
    <li>When cutoff is too low, we have random unpredictable growth of small clusters and the weighted model is worse.</li>
    <li>Optimal cutoffs were similar between data sets (0.014 and 0.011).</li>

# Seattle

    <li>Vertex size scaled to case recency (more recent cases are larger).</li>
    <li>Largest cluster (**1**, 35 known cases) was not adjacent to any new cases; older sampling dates.</li>
    <li>Second-largest cluster (**2**, 10 known cases) more recent, grew by 6 new cases.</li>

# Northern Alberta

    <li>Largest cluster (**1**, 26 known cases) also older, grew by 1 new case only.</li>
    <li>Third-largest cluster (**3**, 10 known cases) more recent, grew by 12 new cases.</li>
    <li>In both data sets, **roughly half of all new cases were not adjacent to any cluster** at the optimized cutoffs (67% Seattle, 42% Northern Alberta).</li>

# Closing remarks

* Our framework provides an objective criterion for defining clusters that maximize public health value.
* Using stricter distance cutoffs can subvert the public health value of clusters.
* The GAIC framework is not limited to case recency; the Poisson model can incorporate **any number of predictors**.
* It is not limited to pairwise distance clustering; it can evaluate **any partition** of known cases.
