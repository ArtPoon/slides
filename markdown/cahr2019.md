# Clusters in genetic space

* Spatial clustering may be less useful for pathogens that are transmitted by intimate contact.

* HIV-1 evolves so rapidly that the virus infection becomes unique to each person within months.

* A group of people diagnosed with HIV-1 that are genetically similar may have been affected by an outbreak.

* Routine genotyping presents an opportunity to detect outbreaks in "near real time".

---

# Protect people

* Genetic clustering has also been misused as forensic evidence in HIV-1 transmission cases.

<center><h2>HIV is not a crime.</h2><center> 

* Clustering must be done in a way that **does not add risk to individuals**, while providing a measurable benefit for public health.

* Reach out to groups without targeting the individual.

# Are genetic clusters helpful?

* If we are going to use genetic clustering to guide public health decisions in "near real time"...

* ... we need to be able to evaluate whether genetic clusters can help us make better decisions.

> Our aim is to develop a new statistical framework where it is possible to evaluate a clustering method against any other method of prioritizing groups.

# Pairwise clustering

* We start by analyzing the simplest method.

* **Pairwise distance clustering** is a popular approach that builds up clusters from pairs of sequences (*e.g.,* [HIV-TRACE](https://github.com/veg/hivtrace)).

* This threshold is often entirely arbitrary!

* (Some studies have used **longitudinal HIV-1 divergence** &mdash; how far a patient's own virus population may evolve &mdash; to select a threshold, *e.g.*, B.C.)

---

# Optimizing the cutoff

* The genetic distance is affected as much by when a person's infection is **diagnosed** as when they were **infected**$^1$.

* There is no such thing as a "gold standard" cutoff that is best for all settings.

* If the cutoff is too relaxed (high), then nearly all HIV-1 sequences will appear in a single giant cluster.

* Too strict (low), then every sequence is a cluster of one.

# The modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP)

* This is a common problem in spatial statistics.

* Statistical associations depend on how you partition geographic space into units of observation.

# MAUP and HIV clustering

* We propose to draw an analogy between geography and **genetic space**.

* Unquestioningly using some cutoff for HIV clustering is ignoring how different boundaries can be drawn on a map.

* How can we justify using one set of boundaries instead of another?
