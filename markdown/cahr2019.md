# Clusters in genetic space

* Spatial clustering may be less useful for pathogens that are transmitted by intimate contact.

* HIV-1 evolves so rapidly that the virus infection becomes unique to each person within months.

* A group of people diagnosed with HIV-1 that are genetically similar may have been affected by an outbreak.

* Routine genotyping presents an opportunity to detect outbreaks in "near real time".

# The ethical challenge

* Genetic clustering has also been misused as forensic evidence in HIV-1 transmission cases.

<center><h2>HIV is not a crime.</h2><center> 

* Clustering must be done in a way that **does not add risk to individuals**, while providing a measurable benefit for public health.
