# Review

* Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is the generation of a full-length sequence of an organism's genome.

# What is GWAS?

* Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) attempt to identify associations between genotypes and phenotypes.
  * More specifically, GWAS tests for a statistical association between a genetic polymorphism and a phenotype, such as a disease.
* GWAS usually focuses on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but any kind of genetic variant can have an association.
  * *e.g.*, copy-number variants (CNVs).

* Annotation is a time-consuming process that is necessary to make a genome sequence useful.
* Many kinds of features can be identified at the nucleotide level, including protein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs.
  * The majority of transcribed genes in the annotated human genome are non-coding.
* Many gene finding programs have used hidden Markov models.
  * The presence or absence of a protein-coding gene can be represented by a sequence of latent states.
