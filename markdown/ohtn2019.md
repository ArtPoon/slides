### A molecular phylogeny is a hypothesis about how sequences are related by common ancestors

<img src="/img/phylogeny.png" width="40%"/>

* We infer that two sequences share a common ancestor from their genetic similarity.

    <ul>
      <li>HIV evolves rapidly - a new infection becomes unique within weeks.</li>
      <li>If two infections are still similar when diagnosed, they are probably related through an unknown number of recent transmission events.</li>

### How does cluster-based public health work in BC?

* System analyzes the anonymized clinical database every hour.
* Reports are reviewed by joint committee of public health and lab staff.
* If the appearance of new cases in a cluster is deemed of significant health concern, the medical health officer uses the *pre-existing protocol* to request the secure transfer of identifying information for no fewer than 5 individuals.  **The "networks" are never de-identified.**
* Public health contacts those individuals to confirm access to treatment and re-offer the same prevention services that are offered for every new diagnosis (*e.g.,* anonymous partner referral).

  <h3>What are the risks?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Phylogenetic and cluster analyses have been used in the prosecution of people in HIV transmission cases.</li>
    <li>Police subpeona clinical and research labs to access data for such cases (these have *always* been refused in BC).</li>
    <li>The development of *source attribution* methods to reconstruct "who infected whom" is an active area of research in phylogenetics.</li>
  </ul>

### How do we minimize risk?

* Most of these risks already exist in the absence of cluster analysis (clinical genotyping).
* Guiding principle: **Confer benefits to public health without increasing personal risk.**
* System is physically and network secured.
* All phylogenetic data are immediately destroyed.
* No information from this system has ever been used in the prosecution of a person living with HIV.
