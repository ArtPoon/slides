### A molecular phylogeny is a hypothesis about how sequences are related by common ancestors

* We infer that two sequences share a common ancestor from their genetic similarity.

### Clusters of genetically similar infections may represent transmission outbreaks

* HIV evolves rapidly - a new infection becomes unique within weeks.
* If two infections are still similar when diagnosed, they are probably related through an unknown number of recent transmission events.

### How does cluster-based public health work?

* System analyzes the anonymized clinical database, detects new cases within a known genetic cluster.
