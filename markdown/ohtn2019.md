### The HIV genome evolves very quickly

* A mutation occurs when the enzyme that converts the HIV genome into DNA adds the wrong nucleotide.
* Our cells also make enzymes that force the HIV genome to mutate &mdash; most mutations break something.

* Sequencing the region encoding the main targets of drug treatment is used to predict if an infection is becoming resistant.

### A molecular phylogeny is a hypothesis about how sequences are related by common ancestors

<img src="/img/phylogeny.png" width="40%"/>

* We infer that two sequences share a common ancestor from their genetic similarity.

### How does cluster-based public health work in BC?

* Cluster reports are reviewed by joint committee of public health and lab staff.
* If a cluster is deemed of significant concern, the medical health officer uses the *pre-existing protocol* to request the secure transfer of identifying information for no fewer than 5 individuals.  (Public health already has personal IDs.)
* **Cluster "networks" are never de-identified.**
* Public health contacts individuals to confirm access to treatment and re-offer the same prevention services that are offered for every new diagnosis (*e.g.,* anonymous partner referral).

### Source attribution

* Generally speaking, the kinds of sequences used for resistance genotyping and public health monitoring *cannot* be used to infer "who infected whom".
<img src="/img/transtree.png" width="75%"/>
* Overcoming this limitation is (unfortunately) active area of research.
* *e.g.,* "next-generation sequencing", Bayesian inference.

---

### How do we minimize risk?

* These risks already exist in the absence of cluster analysis for public health (*i.e.,* routine clinical genotyping).

> Confer benefits to public health without elevating risks to individuals.

* All phylogenetic outputs are immediately destroyed.
* No information from this system has ever been used in the prosecution of a person living with HIV.
