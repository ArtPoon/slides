# What is bioinformatics?

* New experimental equipment generating enormous amounts of complex data.
* You need computing skills to function in a modern biological lab.
* Bioinformatics is the computational management and analysis of biological data.

# A spectrum of bioinformatics

| Type |  | Usage | Understands methods/models |
|------|--|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Casual end-user | <img width="200px" src="/img/Pointy-haired_Boss.png"> | Requires a push-button interface.  Applying a defined analysis pipeline to their data. | None |
| Informed end-user |  | Can install programs with package manager, sometimes from source. Can run a given pipeline and change settings to fit their data/hypothesis. | Basic |
| Power user |  | Can resolve dependency issues when compiling programs from source.  Can customize a pipeline for new uses. | Comprehensive | 
| Developer |  | Builds new pipelines. Implements/adapts existing methods into new programs. | Expert |
| Computer scientist | <img width="200px" src="/img/alice-dilbert.png"> | Creates new methods and algorithms. | Specialist |

# New technologies

  * Whole genome sequencing (WGS), GWAS
  * Next-generation sequencing (deep sequencing, barcoding, metagenomics, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq)
  * single-cell transcriptomics
  * live-cell imaging data analysis
  * remote sensing (drones, satellites, swarm sensing)
  * Non-relational, distributed databases ("big data")

---

# The command line

* It is impossible to create a "Microsoft Excel" for bioinformatics
* Inevitably you will ask a question that there is no button for.
* Lab technologies move fast.
* No one has time to make nice interfaces.
* Bioinformatics requires "command line fluency", which generally means working with UNIX-like operating systems.
* The most current methods are generally available as open-source software.
