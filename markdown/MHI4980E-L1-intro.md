# What is medical informatics?

>"... the application of computer technology to all fields of medicine -- medical care, medical teaching and medical research" &ndash; Morris F. Collen, MD (1977)
*

---

# What is health informatics?

* applications of information technology to healthcare delivery
* electronic medical records (EMRs)
* data and interoperability standards
* health big data and analytics

# What is bioinformatics?

* Birth of bioinformatics largely credited to [Margaret Dayhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Oakley_Dayhoff) and the *Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure*
* Phylogenetics and the tree of life (Zuckerkandl and Pauling)
* Sequence alignment (Needleman and Wunsch)
* The Free Software movement
* The Human Genome Project and next-generation sequencing

# I'm still confused...

* Don't be.  Field names don't matter.
* Medical informatics literature defines "bioinformatics" as a subfield of MI dealing with molecular and cellular levels of medicine
* This is a lousy definition!
* Bioinformatics literature ignores medical informatics altogether
