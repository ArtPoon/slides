# First scientific journals published in 1665

* Before 1650, common practice was make notes "deliberately obscure, even written in code, cryptic symbols, or anagrams, to protect their secrets from rivals" (Heard, 2016)
* [Royal Society of London]() established in 1660 with principle of plain communication of scientific findings.

# The rise of scientific journals

* Journals played an important role in the dissemination of scientific knowledge in 17th to 19th centuries.
* Most journals were published by scientific societies.
* Overtaken by commercial publishers around the mid-1990s.

# The Elsevier Vioxx scandal

* Merck developed an anti-inflammatory drug Rofecoxib (Vioxx) to treat rheumatoid arthritis.
* Working with Elsevier, Merck published the <i>Australasian Journal of Bone & Joint Medicine</i> from 2002 to 2005, including articles promoting Vioxx without peer review.
* "Several leading rheumatologists" were listed on the advisory panel "without their consent or even knowledge" ([Jasper et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1080/0965254X.2017.1384752)).
* Rofecoxib associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease, estimated to have caused "between 88,000 and 140,000 excess cases" ([Graham et al. 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673605178647))

---

# The Serials Crisis

* University libraries could no longer keep up with the rising subscription costs of journals.
* Subscription bundling forces libraries to purchase access to large numbers of journals.
* In 2010, Elsevier reported a profit of &pound;724 million on a revenue of &pound;2 billion &mdash; a higher profit margin than Apple, Google or Amazon that year ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science); Buranyi, 2017).

---

# "The Cost of Knowledge" Boycott

* Elsevier lobbied for the [Research Works Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Works_Act) (US, 2011) that would undo the NIH's public access policy (NIH-funded research released to public domain within 12 months of publication).
* This, among other issues (*e.g.*, questionable journal content, subscription bundling), motivated a boycott by academics against Elsevier's business practices.
* The University of California [terminated its contract](https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/uc-and-elsevier/) with Elsevier in 2019, and signed an [open access deal](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/huge-open-access-journal-deal-inked-university-california-and-springer-nature) with Springer in 2020.


---

# Chaos, Solitons and Fractals

* An "interdisciplinary journal of nonlinear science" published by Elsevier.
* The editor-in-chief published a total of 323 single-author papers in his own journal (57 in 2008).
* Excessive amount of self-citation; 137 articles not published by the editor-in-chief explicitly mention him by name in the title or abstract.
* Journal halted due to this controversy in 2008, and resumed in the next year with resignation of the editor-in-chief.

---

# The birth of open access

* NIH director [Harold Varmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_E._Varmus) conceived of E-Biomed in 1999, which would eventually become [PubMed Central](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
* In 2000, Varmus and colleagues [Michael Eisen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Eisen) and [Patrick Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_O._Brown) co-founded the [Public Library of Science](https://plos.org/).
* Open access model:
  * publications are freely available to anyone online
  * journals do not charge subscription fees
  * cost recovery by author publication fees

---

# Explosive growth of OA

* Open access is a highly profitable model.
  * Digital access = no printing costs.
  * No monetary compensation for peer review and editorship.
* The rise of the [mega-journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_journal).
  * Pioneered by [PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/), followed by [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep/), [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/) and many more!
  * Accept papers if they are methodologically sound, not if they are interesting.
  * Cover a broad range of subjects.
  * Publish a larger number of papers per issue.

---

# Rise of the predators

* A predatory journal:
  * has a low barrier to accepting manuscripts with limited peer review, if any
  * broadly solicits academics to join the editorial board, or lists them without permission
  * advertises fake or spurious impact factors
  * sends e-mail spam to solicit articles
* Predatory publishers tend to feature an enormous roster of journals.
  * *e.g.* MDPI was established in 1996 and publishes 272 journal titles (53 in 2020).
* Related: [hijacked journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_hijacking), [predatory conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_conference)

# Why are predatory journals a problem?

* predatoryjournals.com lists 1,177 predatory *publishers* (last update Jan 2017), each with multiple titles.
* Publishing questionable research without rigorous peer review: creationism, vaccine hesitancy, conspiracy theories.
* Gaming the system by publishing an enormous number of articles:
  * plagarism, falsification and/or duplication of results (see [image forensics](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01363-z)).
  * self-referencing to boost your personal metrics (*e.g.*, [h-index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index)).
* Enormous peer review burden.

# Beall's list

* [Jeffrey Beall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Beall) is a librarian formerly employed by the University of Colorado Denver who coined the term "predatory journal"
* Beall created and maintained a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beall%27s_List) of predatory journals online from 2008 to 2017.
* Criticized for subjective evaluation, lack of transparency and evidence.
* The Canadian Center for Science and Education and the [OMICS Publishing Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMICS_Publishing_Group) send letters to Beall threatening to sue for defamation.
* Eventually harassment from MDPI and Frontiers led Beall to take the list offline.

---

# Vindication

* In 2013, the journal Science [published the results](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60/) of a "sting" operation in which a fake, deeply flawed paper was submitted to 304 journals.
  * 82% of journals on Beall's List accepted the paper.
  * Some journals from Elsevier, Sage and Wolters Kluwer also published the paper.
* In 2017, Nature creates a fake scientist who applies for the editorial board of 360 journals.
  * 33% of the 120 journals selected from Beall's list accepted the application.
* In 2019, the US Federal Trade Commission is awarded $50M from a lawsuit against OMICS.

# Other resources

* [Eriksson and Helgesson's list](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487745/) - a list of criteria for classifying predatory journals, *e.g.*, "The journal and the publisher are unfamiliar to you and all your colleagues."
* [Thick. Check. Submit.](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/) - maintains a less comprehensive checklist for selecting a journal.

# What makes a journal "good"?

* For every field, there is an evolving community consensus on which journals are "good" and which are not as good.
* The latter category should not include predatory journals - they might be from less reputable publishers..
* In the field of virology, for example, the hierarchy used to be:
  1. *J Virol* (ASM)
  2. *Virology* (Elsevier)
  3. *J Gen Virol* (Microbiology Society, UK)
* Now there is mBio (ASM), Virology J (BMC), Frontiers in Micro, Viruses (MDPI) and more.

# Impact factor

* A [controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor#Criticism) measure of journal quality based on the average number of citations.
* Currently published by Clarivate, a publicly-traded US company that acquired the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) in 1992.
* Calculated by counting article citations in the [Journal Citation Reports](https://jcr.clarivate.com/) database:

$$IF = \frac{\text{Citations in current year to papers in last 2 years}}
{\text{Articles published in last 2 years}}$$

* IF can be inflated by ["citation stacking"](https://www.nature.com/news/brazilian-citation-scheme-outed-1.13604?WT.mc_id=PIN_NatureNews), soliciting review articles and methods papers.

---

# Alternatives to IF

* Many journals advocate the use of other [bibliometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics) to quantify the impact of articles or journals.
* Other services offer article-level metrics such as [PlumX](https://plumanalytics.com/learn/about-metrics/) and [Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/about-altmetrics/what-are-altmetrics/):
<img src="/img/altmetrics.png" height="150px"/>

* [San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment](https://sfdora.org/read/) recommends *against* the use of journal-level metrics; *e.g.*, recommends institutions base promotions on criteria.
