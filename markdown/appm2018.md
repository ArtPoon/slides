# Background
## Genetic clustering
* A subset of infections that are more genetically similar than other infections.
* Early uses of genetic clusters for HSV-1, TB.
* Enormous number of *ad hoc* approaches to genetic clustering, no standard.
* Development of these methods largely orthogonal to space-time clustering.

---

# Background
## HIV-1 clustering
* Rapidly evolution on similar time scale as transmission
* HIV-1 establishes life-long chronic infection
* About 1,000nt of the virus genome routinely sequenced to screen for drug resistance
* Abundant data accumulating at centers of HIV research and care

# Background
## Scott County

* 135 new HIV diagnoses from January to April 2015 in a rural community of about 4,200 persons in Indiana

# Background
## Real-time surveillance

* Is it possible to predict when an outbreak is going to occur, and intervene earlier?
* Contact tracing is time-consuming, missing information?
* Is it possible to gain net public health benefit using genetic data while minimizing individual risk?

# Background
## Clusters and public health
* The first real-world example of real-time monitoring of a genetic cluster guiding a public health response
* Similar systems presently being implemented at multiple sites around the world.
* Genetic clustering software becoming popular (ClusterPicker, HIV-TRACE).

---

# Clustering methods
## Pairwise distances

* A genetic distance $d$ is a function that maps two sequences $s,t\rightarrow \mathbb{R},\; \text{s.t.}\; d(s,s)=0$
* A simple example is the Hamming distance (number of differences between two aligned sequences)
* Cluster pairs of sequences whose distance falls below some threshold $d*$

---

# Clustering methods
## Phylogenies

* A molecular phylogeny is a tree-based model of how sequences are related by common ancestors
<img src="/img/trees.png" height="350"/>

---

# Clustering methods
## Subtree clustering

* Several different criteria can be used to label a subtree as a cluster
* *e.g.,* mean branch length within subtree
* Bootstrap support - a measure of confidence in subtree given the data

<img src="/img/clustering-clip.png" height="250"/>

---

# Clustering methods
## Getting skeptical about clusters
* Volz *et al.* (2012): "virus from recent infections tend to be phylogenetically clustered at a greater rate.."
* Villandre *et al.* (2016): "...common methods often have limited success in detecting contact network communities from phylogenies."
* Dearlove *et al.* (2017): "...groups of closely related viruses can also occur due to [...] over-sampling."

# Simulation
## Compartmental models

* Test clustering methods by simulating outbreaks.
* Systems of ordinary differential equations.
* Each variable corresponds to the size of a subpopulation (susceptible, infected).
* Forward-time simulation of reaction kinetics with @tgvaughan's [MASTER](https://github.com/tgvaughan/MASTER/wiki) program.

# Model-based clustering
## Transition rates and branching rates

`$$
\begin{align*}
	Q &= 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    	-\sigma_1 & \sigma_{12} & \cdots & \sigma_{1m} \\
        \sigma_{21} & -\sigma_2 & \cdots & \sigma_{2m} \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        \sigma_{m1} & \sigma_{m2} & \cdots & \sigma_{m}
    \end{bmatrix} \\
    \sigma_i &= \sum_{j \neq i} \sigma_{ij} \\
    \vec{\lambda} &= [\lambda_1,\, \ldots,\, \lambda_m]^T \\
    \Lambda &= \mathrm{diag}({\vec{\lambda}}).
\end{align*}
$$`

---

# Model-based clustering
## Likelihood

* Exponentially distributed waiting times between branching events:
  <center>`$f(t) = \exp((Q - \Lambda) t) \Lambda$`</center>

* Adapted Felsenstein's pruning algorithm:
`$$
\begin{align*}
  L_i(v) &= \sum_j f_{ij}(t_v) L_j(w) L_j(z). \\
  L_i(\tau) &= \pi_i L_i(w) L_i(z) \\
  L(\tau) &= \sum_i L_i(\tau).
\end{align*}

# Model-based clustering
## Incomplete sampling

* We assumed near-complete sampling of infected population
* if we reduce sampling to 50%, high false positive rate!

# Model-based clustering
## Incomplete sampling

* Worst-case scenario -- groups with high transmission rates have low sampling rates:

# Model-based clustering
## Applied to real data

* Retrospective study of HIV-1 infections sampled between February 2000 and March 2003 in Seattle, USA.
* All sequences were deposited in GenBank ahead of publication (very unusual!).
* Clusters extracted using ClusterPicker.
* Used as evidence of HIV transmission between older and younger men.

# Model-based clustering
## Concluding remarks

* MMPP seems to confer greater accuracy for detecting clusters of transmission
* *All* methods suffer from high false positive rate due to incomplete sampling
* We really need to work on these methods before using them to guide public health decisions!

# clmp
##  An R module (Clustering with MMPP)

```R
> require(clmp)
Loading required package: clmp
Loading required package: ape

> t1 <- read.tree('examples/test.nwk')  # a simulated tree with 1000 tips, 100 in clusters
> res <- clmp(t1)  # returns an ape::phylo tree object 
log likelihood for 2 state model is 2238.543290
rates: 495.368085 1305.115860 
Q: [    *   2.526691 ]
   [ 23.309483   *    ]

> index <- match(t1$tip.label, names(res$clusters))  
> labels <- grepl("_1_", t1$tip.label)  # extract truth from the tip labels
> table(labels, res$clusters[index])
      
labels    0   1
  FALSE 860   3  # false positive rate, 3/(3+860)=0.34%
  TRUE   13  98  # true positive rate, 98/(98+13)=88.2%
```

---

# clmp
## Lots to do

* clmp tends to fail on maximum likelihood trees with near-zero branch lengths
* gets confused by exponential growth at start of epidemic
* does not look at variation in sampling rates (terminal branches)
* has yet to be used in "the field".
